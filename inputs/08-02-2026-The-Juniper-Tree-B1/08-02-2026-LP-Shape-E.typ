  By the end of the lesson, learners will have practiced and developed the sub-skills of reading for gist and detailed comprehension in the context of a dark Brothers Grimm fairy tale about retribution and rebirth.

#differentiation_box[
  This lesson provides differentiated support through:
  - **Visual Scaffolding:** Using "Grimm vs Disney" imagery to establish the dark tone before reading.
  - **Vocabulary Pre-teaching:** Isolating 5 key "blocking words" (fortune, seized, retribution, millstone, enchanted) to reduce cognitive load during reading.
  - **Task Grading:** Moving from a simple binary gist task (happy/sad) to more complex sequencing and matching tasks.
  - **Peer Support:** Utilizing Think-Pair-Share and ORE (Opinion-Reason-Example) frameworks to structure speaking output for weaker learners.
