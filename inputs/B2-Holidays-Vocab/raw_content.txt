Unit 50: Holidays

A. Here are a number of different places where you can spend a holiday.
- camp site: a place where you can pitch a tent or park a caravan
- self-catering flat: flat which you rent, you cook for yourself
- guesthouse: accommodation like a hotel but cheaper and with fewer services
- youth hostel: cheap accommodation, mainly for young people, with, perhaps, ten or more people sleeping in bunk beds in one room
- holiday camp: a place providing holiday accommodation in little chalets or flats, with restaurants, bars, swimming pools and lots of other facilities and entertainment
- time-share apartment: accommodation which one owns, say, a 26th part of and so has the right to stay there for 2 weeks every year

B. Here are a number of different things which people like to do on holiday.
- sunbathe
- swim or go swimming
- do some or go sightseeing
- ski or go skiing
- go for a drive
- hike or go hiking
- tour or go touring
- go on an excursion
- climb or go climbing/mountaineering
- camp or go camping

Note: You usually ask 'Have you ever been skiing/hang-gliding?' rather than 'Have you ever gone?' 'He's been wind-surfing' means that at some point in his life he has done this.

C. Here is some useful language for when you are staying in a hotel.
- I'd like to book a single/double room with a cot.
- I'd like a room with a shower, a colour TV, and a view of the sea.
- What time do you serve breakfast?
- Am I too late for dinner/to get something to eat?
- Is service included?
- Could I have a call at 7.30, please?
- Could we have dinner in our room, please?
- The teasmade [tea-making machine] in my room isn't working.
- I'd like an extra pillow, please.
- I'd like to make a call to New Zealand, please.
- What time do you like rooms to be vacated by?
- Sorry to bother you, but...
- I'm afraid there's something wrong with the..., could you have a look at it?
