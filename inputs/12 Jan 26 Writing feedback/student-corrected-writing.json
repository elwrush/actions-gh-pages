    "use_of_english_comment": "Hi Satang! Good to see you putting in the effort to describe these famous spots in Thailand. You've clearly got a good handle on the topic.<br><br>Here's what you did well:<br><br><ul>  <li>✨ <b>Vocabulary Range</b>: You used some solid, topic-specific words like \"monuments,\" \"stunning structure,\" and \"tourist attraction\" to make your descriptions more interesting.</li>  <li>🎯 <b>Grammatical Range</b>: I noticed you tried some more difficult structures, like using an appositive to explain what Ayutthaya is and a conditional sentence starting with \"if.\"</li>  <li>💪 <b>Punctuation and Capitalisation</b>: Your use of capital letters for names like \"Ayutthaya\" and \"Wat Phra Kaew\" was spot on, and you used full stops correctly throughout.</li></ul><br><br>Now for some areas to work on. I'll explain WHY you're making these mistakes so you can avoid them next time:<br><br><ol><li><b>📝 Missing \"BE\" Verbs (is/am/are)</b><br><b>What you wrote:</b> <i>\"Ayutthaya, a major province in Thailand that famous of amazing monuments.\"</i><br><b>Correct version:</b> <i>\"Ayutthaya <b>is</b> a major province in Thailand that <b>is</b> famous <b>for its</b> amazing monuments.\"</i><br><b>Why this happens:</b> In Thai, you can sometimes skip the linking verb, especially with adjectives. For example, you might say \"มันเก่า\" (it old). But in English, every sentence needs a main verb, and adjectives usually need \"is,\" \"am,\" or \"are\" to link them to the subject.</li><li><b>📝 Missing Articles and Determiners</b><br><b>What you wrote:</b> <i>\"The next place is Wat Phra Kaew, Thai temple that is known for stunning structure.\"</i><br><b>Correct version:</b> <i>\"The next place is Wat Phra Kaew, <b>a</b> Thai temple known for <b>its</b> stunning structure.\"</i><br><b>Why this happens:</b> Thai doesn't use words like \"a,\" \"an,\" or \"the\" before nouns. In English, we need \"a\" because you are talking about one temple, and \"its\" to show that the structure belongs to that specific temple.</li><li><b>📝 Word Form (Nouns vs Adjectives)</b><br><b>What you wrote:</b> <i>\"Thai people mostly are friendly, if you act polite and respect.\"</i><br><b>Correct version:</b> <i>\"Thai people <b>are mostly</b> friendly if you act polite and <b>respectful</b>.\"</i><br><b>Why this happens:</b> You used the word \"respect,\" which is a noun (ความเคารพ) or a verb (เคารพ). However, because you are describing a person, you need the adjective \"respectful\" (ที่มีความเคารพ) to match \"polite.\" I also adjusted the word order to make it sound more natural.</li><li><b>📝 Plural Nouns</b><br><b>What you wrote:</b> <i>\"Wat Phra Kaew is surround by Jayde (mini version of temple), makes Wat Phra Kaew a tourist attraction.\"</i><br><b>Correct version:</b> <i>\"Wat Phra Kaew is <b>surrounded</b> by <b>Chedis</b> (mini <b>versions</b> of <b>temples</b>), <b>which</b> makes Wat Phra Kaew a tourist attraction.\"</i><br><b>Why this happens:</b> In Thai, nouns don't change if there is more than one. You might say \"เจดีย์หลายองค์\" without changing the word \"เจดีย์.\" In English, when you speak about things in general or in groups, you usually need to add an \"s.\" I also fixed \"surrounded\" because it is a passive action.</li></ol><br><br>Your advice about being kind and respectful is a nice touch to wrap up your travel tips. Keep up the writing!<br><br><b>📊 Your Grammar Analysis</b><br><br>I analysed your grammar using Cambridge University's <b>ERRANT</b> script (ERRor ANnotation Toolkit), which is a tool that compares what you wrote against a corrected version to identify grammatical errors. It shows that you wrote <b>8</b> sentences, and <b>0</b> of them had no errors.<br><br><b>Your error breakdown:</b><br><ol><li><b>Missing Determiners (a/the/its):</b> 4 instances</li><li><b>Punctuation and extra words:</b> 4 instances</li><li><b>Noun errors (Plurals/Choice):</b> 3 instances</li><li><b>Missing Verbs:</b> 2 instances</li><li><b>Verb Form Errors:</b> 1 instance</li><li><b>Preposition Errors:</b> 1 instance</li><li><b>Word Order Errors:</b> 1 instance</li></ol>",
