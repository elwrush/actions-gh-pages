[00:00] Several hundred,000 people in Thailand
[00:02] and Cambodia have been ordered to
[00:04] evacuate as a new wave of fightings
[00:06] erupted between the Southeast Asian
[00:09] neighbors. Both sides
[00:12] both sides are blaming each other for
[00:15] starting the fighting. Thailand's air
[00:18] force said it struck Cambodian military
[00:20] targets along the disputed border,
[00:22] describing them as heavy weapons and
[00:25] combat personnel that could be a threat.
[00:28] Cambodia has denied provoking violence
[00:30] and has asked observers from the
[00:32] regional block ASEAN to investigate the
[00:35] Thai claims they not to retaliate.
[00:40] Well, let's speak now to Panisha Amocha
[00:43] who is following developments for us at
[00:46] the BBC. What is the latest?
[00:50] So we recently just have the press
[00:52] conference from Thailand Prime Minister
[00:55] Anutin Chanagun who said that he believe
[00:58] in Thai military forces and according to
[01:00] the datas that we received the Thai
[01:02] military has uh deployed air strike to
[01:06] target the Cambodian uh military site
[01:09] and military positions. Um while in the
[01:12] Cambodia they said that they have not
[01:14] retaliate against Thailand at the
[01:17] moment. Um so this conflict this
[01:20] confrontation is one of the most severe
[01:22] one ever since the ceasefire back in
[01:25] July and people's um we have seen images
[01:29] for both Thai sides and the Cambodian
[01:31] sides of people in the borders area that
[01:33] they have to evacuate it a lot of people
[01:36] are have to evacuate it to shelters or
[01:39] even to their relative houses but
[01:41] there's still a lot of fragile uh
[01:44] peoples who have like health issue that
[01:46] stills affected
[01:48] school has been shut. We are talking
[01:49] about students cannot go to school for
[01:52] both country and for both sides.
[01:54] >> Okay. So both uh sides taking steps to
[01:58] keep people safe in the meantime but
[01:59] there is concern about what might happen
[02:01] next, how far this could escalate. Uh
[02:04] what are people saying about that?
[02:08] So we have seen um Malaysian's prime
[02:11] minister Anbar Ibrahims about two hours
[02:14] ago expressed concerned that um this
[02:17] confrontations will escalate and in the
[02:19] part we have seen that he was trying or
[02:22] we're trying to talk to the head of
[02:24] state for both country to try to
[02:26] negotiate and mitigate um the conflict
[02:29] when the conflict happens. the Thai
[02:31] sides I've talked to a few local
[02:34] resident they want this conver um they
[02:36] want this confrontation to end this is
[02:38] not just happening now it's affect their
[02:41] life for so many months at the moment
[02:43] they have to be in their house then
[02:45] evacuated to the shelters that cannot
[02:47] work we could imagine that similar
[02:50] situations happen to the Cambodian side
[02:52] as well so what we really want to see is
[02:55] the two country to talk things out or if
[02:57] they can't because they have the measure
[03:00] they have the joy committee, borders
[03:02] committee to talk to each other. But it
[03:03] has been proven time and times again
[03:05] that this mean is really not useful. So
[03:08] when we have the third party for
[03:10] examples like the Malaysian's prime
[03:12] minister Azen or even the US President
[03:14] Donald Trump trying to be the third um
[03:17] person or the third person to try to
[03:19] mitigate this one. So the two country
[03:21] really want this to be effective.
[03:23] >> Okay. Penanisha now thank you very much
[03:26] for bringing us right up to date. We
[03:28] have got a live page that's running at
[03:30] the moment on the BBC website and the
[03:31] news app as you can see here with the
[03:34] very latest details. We're keeping a
[03:35] very close eye on that fractious very
[03:38] fractious uh situation between the two
[03:40] countries.
