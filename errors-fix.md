# Errors & Fixes Log

## 2025-12-26

### SVG Logo Not Rendering in Google Slides
- **Issue**: Bell.svg uploaded to Drive but wouldn't render in Slides API
- **Cause**: SVG format not well-supported by Slides API image insertion
- **Fix**: Use existing `images/Bell.png` instead of SVG

### Logo Placement Design Issues
- **Issue**: Initially placed logos at bottom corners (unconventional)
- **Fix**: Researched co-branding best practices → logos should be in header bar side-by-side ("lock-up" pattern)

### Duplicate Template Creation
- **Issue**: Created new template instead of updating existing one
- **Fix**: Rewrote script to update existing template ID; deleted duplicate

### Text Color on Maroon Background
- **Issue**: Strap line and title text initially maroon (invisible on maroon background)
- **Fix**: Changed to white text for proper contrast
