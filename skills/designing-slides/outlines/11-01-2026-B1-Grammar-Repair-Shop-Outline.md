# Slideshow Outline: The Grammar Repair Shop

## Slide 1: THE GRAMMAR REPAIR SHOP
- **Precision Engineering for Writers**
- Ed Rush | 12 Jan 2026

## Slide 2: Transition: Opening the Garage
- "Welcome to the workshop. Today, we're not just 'writing'—we're fine-tuning your communication engine."

## Slide 3: The Mechanic's Mindset
- Every great car needs maintenance.
- Every great writer needs a "Diagnostic Check".
- Today, YOU are the lead mechanics.
- We aren't looking for "mistakes"—we're identifying "repair points".

## Slide 4: The Diagnostic Report (ERRANT)
- **Cambridge University's ERRANT** Toolkit.
- Our specialized sensor system that scans your writing for:
  - Missing parts (is, the, a)
  - Broken parts (wrong word forms)
  - Extra parts (clogging the flow)

## Slide 5: Reading the Data
- Your report is YOUR personalized diagnostic.
- It shows exactly where your engine is leaking.
- Focus on the **Frequency** – what happens most often?

## Slide 6: Transition: Selecting the Right Spanners
- "A mechanic is only as good as their preparation. Let's pick our tools..."

## Slide 7: Mission Prep: Mapping the Faults
- Review your individualized Profile.
- Choose your **Top 3 Repair Targets**.
- Write them into your Worksheet header.
- Be specific: "Noun Plurals" is better than "Nouns".

## Slide 8: Choosing Your Grade
- Not all repairs are the same complexity.
- Select the task that pushes your engine:
  - **Level A2**: The Secret Recipe (50+ words)
  - **Level B1**: The Masterchef Warning (70+ words)
  - **Level B2**: Signature Dishes (100+ words)

## Slide 9: Transition: Activating the Sensors
- "Before we turn the key, let's switch on our high-tech monitoring systems..."

## Slide 10: The Hero Tool: Self-Correction Radar
- Use the **Radar Checklist** *at the top of your task*.
- It's like a dashboard warning light:
  - Did I check my plurals?
  - Are my articles in place?
- Don't wait until the end – check as you go!

## Slide 11: Transition: Getting Under the Hood
- "Tools in hand, radar on. It's time to get to work."

## Slide 12: Precision Drafting
- Write your paragraph in the workshop area.
- Focus on **Accuracy** over Speed.
- Listen for the "engine noise" – does it sound right?
- The Head Mechanic (T) is circulating for consultation.

## Slide 13: Transition: The Mandatory Safety Check
- "Every car needs a second pair of eyes before it leaves the workshop."

## Slide 14: Quality Control: Peer Inspection
- Swap your paragraph with a fellow mechanic.
- Check their **3 Targets** ONLY.
- Highlight successes first: "This part is running smooth!"
- Polite feedback: "I think this part still needs a little tightening..."

## Slide 15: Transition: Ready for the Road
- "Repairs complete. The output is clean, efficient, and ready to go."

## Slide 16: The Final Checkout
- Feedback reflection.
- Which grammar point was the easiest to "fix"?
- Which part of your writing is now 100% efficient?
- Hand in your worksheets and reports.
