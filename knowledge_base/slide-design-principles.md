\# Top 15 Rules for Educational Slide Design



Effective slide design enhances learning by reducing cognitive load, focusing attention, and aiding comprehension. Follow these 15 rules to create slides that educate rather than overwhelm.



\- \*\*Keep it simple\*\*: Limit text to 5-7 lines per slide with no more than 6 words per line. Avoid clutter—every element should serve the learning goal.



\- \*\*One idea per slide\*\*: Focus on a single key concept or takeaway. Break complex topics into multiple slides to prevent overwhelming the audience.



\- \*\*Use high-contrast colors\*\*: Pair dark text on light backgrounds (or vice versa) for readability. Stick to 2-3 colors total; test for color blindness accessibility.



\- \*\*Large, readable fonts\*\*: Use sans-serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Helvetica) at 24pt+ for body text and 44pt+ for titles. Ensure legibility from the back of the room.



\- \*\*Leverage visuals over text\*\*: Replace bullets with images, diagrams, or icons that illustrate concepts. Visuals boost retention by 65% per Mayer's research.



\- \*\*Follow the 10-20-30 rule\*\*: Aim for no more than 10 slides, 20 minutes, and 30pt font minimum (adapted for education from Guy Kawasaki).



\- \*\*Align elements consistently\*\*: Use grids for straight lines and even spacing. Left-align text and avoid centering for better scannability.



\- \*\*Minimize animations and transitions\*\*: Use subtle builds only to reveal points sequentially. Avoid flashy effects that distract from content.



\- \*\*Incorporate white space\*\*: Leave 30-50% of the slide empty. Generous margins prevent a crowded feel and guide the eye to key elements.



\- \*\*Choose relevant, high-quality images\*\*: Ensure visuals directly support the message. Crop tightly, use royalty-free sources, and maintain consistent style.



\- \*\*Signal emphasis with size and position\*\*: Make the most important element largest and highest on the slide (F-pattern reading flow).



\- \*\*Avoid reading slides aloud\*\*: Design slides as visual aids, not scripts. Speak to elaborate—slides should prompt discussion, not recitation.



\- \*\*Use data visualization wisely\*\*: Prefer charts over tables; simplify axes and labels. Bar charts for comparisons, lines for trends.



\- \*\*Ensure hierarchy with typography\*\*: Bold titles, regular body text, and subtle subtitles create clear structure. Limit font families to two.



\- \*\*Test for accessibility\*\*: Add alt text to images, use semantic headings, and check contrast ratios (WCAG 4.5:1 minimum). Preview in grayscale.
